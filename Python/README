Here are all the Python scripts used during the project. 
The Fetcher scripts are script created for data retrival.

List of scripts:
Add_annotations.py:     Adds eggNOG v5 annotations to gene list. 
add_taxid.py:           Format change NCBI headers for Kraken 2
BUSCO_fetcher.py:       Takes the BUSCO score from multiple BUSCO output files and puts in a tab-formatted table.
cluster_membership.py:  Gives a list with for each genes annotation: gene, cluster, accession and tissue. Also gives list of cluster with only one gene. 
Flagstat_Fetcher.py:    Takes the stats from multiple flagstat files and puts them in a tab-formatted table. 
Isoform_chooser.py      Picks an isoform in each cluster based on longest cooding sequence. The quality aswell as the completeness is also in the code to be selected for. 
Kraken_Fetcher.py:      Latest version. Only demands Kraken file as input. Prepares a file of wanted genes from approved  taxies. Soft filter approach for Embryophyta. 
taxi_sorter.py:         Sort eggNOG-mapper v2 output; as to get gene list from only desired taxi
